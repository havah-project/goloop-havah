/**
 * Interface for object write.
 *
 * <p>An object is writable if the object is a builtin object or its class
 * has the following method.
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *  public static void writeObject(ObjectWriter w, UserClass obj)
 * </pre></blockquote>
 *
 * <p>A builtin object is a simple object or a container object. A simple object
 * is
 * a {@link Boolean}, a {@link Byte}, a {@link Short}, a {@link Character},
 * a {@link Integer}, a {@link Float}, a {@link Long}, a {@link Double},
 * a {@link BigInteger}, a {@link String}, byte array or an {@link Address}.
 * They are written by corresponding {@code write} methods. The following is an
 * example of writing simple objects.
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *      objectWriter.write("a string");
 *      objectWriter.write(0);
 * </pre></blockquote>
 *
 * <p>A container object is a list or a map. A container may have another
 * container as its element.
 *
 * <p>A list has zero or more builtin objects as its elements. A list is written
 * by a {@link #beginList(int)} call followed by calls for writings of zero or
 * more its elements followed by a {@link #end} call. For example, the following
 * method writes a list of two elements.
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *      objectWriter.beginList(2);
 *          objectWriter.write(0);
 *          objectWriter.beginList(0);
 *          objectWriter.end();
 *      objectWriter.end();
 * </pre></blockquote>
 *
 * <p>A map has zero or more pairs of objects as its elements. A map is written
 * by a {@link #beginMap(int)} call followed by calls for writings of zero or
 * more its elements followed by a {@link #end} call. For example, the following
 * method writes a map of one element.
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *      objectWriter.beginMap(1);
 *          objectWriter.write("key");
 *          objectWriter.write("value");
 *      objectWriter.end();
 * </pre></blockquote>
 *
 * <p>You can write a custom object indirectly if its class has the following
 * method.
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *  public static void writeObject(ObjectWriter w, UserClass obj)
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * When you write a custom object, the
 * {@code writeObject} method is called. In the method, you must
 * write one equivalent builtin object. It is error to write no object or
 * two or more objects. The method may write one list with multiple elements.
 * For example, the following is error.
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *  public static void writeObject(ObjectWriter w, UserClass obj) {
 *      w.write(obj.name);
 *      w.write(obj.description);
 *  }
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * Instead, write a list with multiple elements if you want to write multiple
 * objects.
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *  public static void writeObject(ObjectWriter w, UserClass obj) {
 *      w.beginList(2);
 *          w.write(obj.name);
 *          w.write(obj.description);
 *      w.end();
 *  }
 * </pre></blockquote>
 *
 * <p>You can write an object as a non-nullable type object or nullable type
 * object. A non-nullable type object is always not null. A nullable object may
 * be null or non-null. A write method writes an object as non-nullable type
 * unless the document specifies the method writes a nullable type object.
 * For example, {@link #write(String)} writes non-nullable type object.
 * {@link #writeNullable(Object)} and {@link #writeNull()} methods
 * write a nullable type object. {@link #beginNullableList(int)} begins a
 * nullable list.
 *
 * <p>Nullable-ness shall be preserved during write and read. If a non-nullable
 * object is written, the object shall be read as a non-nullable object and
 * shall not be read as a nullable object later. If a nullable object is
 * written, the object shall be read as a nullable object and shall not be read
 * a non-nullable object later. For example, if an object is written as the
 * following:
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     Integer i = getInteger();
 *     objectWriter.writeNullable(i);
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * <p>
 * It is error to read the object as the following:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     int i = objectReader.readInt();
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * <p>
 * Instead, the object shall be read as the following:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     Integer i = objectReader.readNullable(Integer.class);
 * </pre></blockquote>
 *
 * <p>If an exception is thrown during any write call, the writer becomes
 * invalidated. An invalidated writer fails any method.
