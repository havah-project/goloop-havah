/**
 * Interface for object read.
 *
 * <p>Common specification for object reader and object writer is specified in
 * {@link ObjectWriter}. It is recommended to read object writer documentation
 * first before you read this documentation.
 *
 * <p>An object is readable if the object is a builtin object or its class
 * has the following method.
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *  public static UserClass readObject(ObjectReader r)
 * </pre></blockquote>
 *
 * <p>A simple object is read by corresponding read method.
 * The following is an example of reading simple objects.
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *      str = objectReader.readString();
 *      i = objectReader.readInt();
 * </pre></blockquote>
 *
 * <p>A list is read by a {@link #beginList} call followed by calls for reading
 * zero or more its elements followed by a {@link #end} call.
 *
 * <p>A map is read by a {@link #beginMap} call followed by calls for reading
 * zero or more its elements followed by a {@link #end} call.
 *
 * <p>You can read a custom object indirectly if its class has the following
 * method.
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *  public static UserClass readObject(ObjectReader r)
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * When you read a custom object of this class, the {@code readObject} method
 * is called. In the method, you must read one equivalent builtin object.
 * It is error to read no object or two or more objects. The method may
 * read on list with multiple elements.
 *
 * <p>If an exception is thrown during any read call, the reader becomes
 * invalidated. An invalidated reader fails any method.
